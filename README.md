# ICU

This is the adaptation of ICU (International Components for Unicode) for Zig programming language. All the unnecessary files for compilation of ICU4C libraries are culled to pare down.

## Roadmap

- [x] Translate compilation and headers installation of `common` library of ICU.
- [ ] Translate build for other libraries of ICU such as `i18n` etc...
- [ ] Translate build for ICU's data-generation tools. Adding a step for generating that data.
- [ ] Port testing to Zig build system

and more...
